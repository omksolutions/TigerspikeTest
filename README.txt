Tigerspike Software Technical Test
----------------------------------

Rate Calculation engine for Car Park

Candidate: Omar Khan
Date: 26 July 2018

Time Spent (Roughly): 2 Hours 7 Minutes

Extra time taken for acquiring a windows PC and installing Visual Studio Community Edition 2017 as well as packaging and uploading solution

Dev Environment: MS Visual Studio 2017 Community
Additional Libraries: None
Testing: Built-In MS VS 2017 Unit Test
Project Type: Standard Microsoft .NET Framework Console Application

Instructions: The solution should be loaded up as normal via .sln file in any latest version of Visual Studio (2015/2017) and can be started using 'Start' from the debugger. This is a simple console application and the 'Program.cs' file contains the entry point into the solution. Please modify the 'Main' method to vary the test input into the program.

Unit Tests: I added a skeleton solution for the unit tests but did not manage to complete all the tests due to time however the tests that are there can simply be run in the normal way (Via test explorer / right-click run all) in the dev environment. My aim was to add both negative and positive unit tests for each of the public methods/interface using valid and invalid inputs.

Approach: 

 - Study of the solution scenario and noting inputs / outputs
 
 - Create test sample application in visual studio

 - Map out basic class heirarchy following a decoupled and maintainable approach

 - Create Interface and implementation of basic car park manager

 - add some placeholder methods

 - Add relevant properties to classes

 - Instantiate properties in constructors

 - Focus on core rate selection logic 

 - Write rate selection logic as per instructions, refactored as per progress

 - Write standard rate calculation logic

 - Write unit tests (incomplete)

 - test and package
